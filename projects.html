<h1>Projects</h1>
	<h2>Social Media Research</h2>
		<p>Group project, which involved conducting research to compare social media use between different genders, analyzing the data and producing a whitepaper to reflect the results and investigation.</p>
	<h2>Human Factors safety</h2>
	<p>Group project focusing on aerospace safety in relation to human factors.</p>
<h1>Relevant Courses</h1>
<h2>PSYC 158 (SJSU) Perception:</h2>
<p>This course went over how humans understand colors, movement and sense our world. It has made me consider how this could be leveraged to aid how people use everyday objects.</p>
<h2>PSYC 135 (SJSU) Cognition:</h2>
<p>Taught knowledge regarding the human processing system, with focus on discussing attention theories and their application </p>
<h2>Advanced Research &amp; Methods: PSYC 120</h2>
<p>With further knowledge of research techniques, I have come to understand how I could use these in an academic and professional setting. </p>
<p>A key skill needed throughout the rest of study, going through various research methods and techniques to be used by researchers.</p>
<h2>PSYC 129 (SJSU) Neuroscience:</h2>
<p>Neuroscience was primarily about understanding more about how the brain operates. Learning about the human brain has given me a new perspective on how different functions within the brain exist, and what they do.</p>
<h2>LING 123 (SJSU) Sound Communication:</h2>
<p>Teaching how sound, and differences in sound are produced, and along with neuroscience further helped me understand how this interacts with the brain. </p>
<p>This course allowed me to consider how important communication is to humans, and how important it is within our modern society. For everyone, let alone those who are less able, and those learning, I know it is vital to understand how humans think and interact with each other, other species, and objects.</p>
