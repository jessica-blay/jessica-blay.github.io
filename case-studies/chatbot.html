    <!-- problem -->
    <div class="w3-container" style="width: 70%; margin:auto;">
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>The client was designing a new chatbot feature on their teaching platform to help users (primarily teachers)
            find information they were looking for more efficiently.</p>
        <p>Key Research Questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Did users notice the new chatbot?</li>
            <li>Given that the users know about the chatbot, would the users choose to use it?</li>
            <li>When using the chatbot, were the users able to find the relevant information or be guided toward the
                correct part of the website?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <!-- methods -->
    <div class="w3-container" style="width: 70%; margin:auto;">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>Since this was performed during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a requirement for all testing to be
            performed remotely, within a timeframe of 6 weeks.<br>
            Methods used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Moderated remote usability study</li>
            <li>Email surveys</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- recruitment -->
    <div class="w3-container" style="width: 70%; margin:auto;">
        <h2>Recruitment</h2>
        <p>The platform was primarily available to teachers and department heads. Due to this, the client already had
            preselected a series of potential candidates, half of whom had experience using the platform (without the
            new functionality), and the other half had no experience of the platform prior to evaluation.</p>

                <h2>Moderated Remote Usability Study</h2>
                <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the evaluation needed to be performed remotely, being recorded over
                    Zoom. In all parts of the usability study users were provided tasks to find information while
                    following a think out loud protocol. They were prompted for their thoughts and attitude several
                    times throughout and after the tasks.<br> Firstly, users were asked open-ended questions to find
                    information that would help their head of department understand why there had been a recent dip in
                    overall student performance. The platform contained a large amount of data that was open to
                    interpretation.<br>
                    For the second part of the study, users were first informed about the existence of the chatbot.
                    Users were again asked to find additional information related to something more specific, and were
                    again reminded about the chatbot prior to starting.<br>
                    In the final part of the study, users were instructed to specifically use the chatbot to find the
                    last pieces of information.<br>

                <h2>Survey</h2>
                <p>After the usability study, participants were emailed surveys to gather demographic data, including
                    prior website usage. The survey was also used to identify discrepancies from the study, clarify
                    trends, and gain any additional thoughts they may have only had after finishing the tasks.</p>

    <!-- analysis -->
    <div class="w3-container" style="width: 70%; margin:auto;">
        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Interviews were transcribed, and then analyzed to determine several dimensions along with the survey
            responses.<br>
            For each dimension, data was collated for metrics, such as shown in the below table.<br>

        <table class="w3-table w3-border w3-bordered w3-centered w3-section">
            <thead>
                <tr class="w3-pale-green">
                    <th>Dimension</th>
                    <th>Positive remarks</th>
                    <th>Neutral remarks</th>
                    <th>Negative remarks</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Chatbot satisfaction</th>
                <th>2</th>
                <th>1</th>
                <th>3</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Chatbot functionality</th>
                <th>4</th>
                <th>0</th>
                <th>2</th>
            </tr>
        </table>


        From the survey data we were able to confirm the categorization of "expert" and "novice" users based on their
        prior experience of the platform, which helped us further evaluate the differences in responses across these
        groups.

    <!-- findings -->
    <div class="w3-container" style="width: 70%; margin:auto;">
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Users were generally unaware of the chatbot unless initially directed toward it.</li>
            <li>Novice users were more likely to use the chatbot, and found it more useful.</li>
            <li>Expert users of the platform were more likely to be frustrated with the chatbot and be hindered by being
                forced into use.</li>
            <li>Specific areas of frustration and confusion with chatbot functionality were identified with
                recommendations based on stated expected outcomes.</li>
        </ul>

                <h2>What if I had the chance to do it again?</h2>
                <p>If I had a chance to perform this evaluation again, I would like to spend more time focused on the
                    chatbot itself, giving participants more scenarios in which they had to use the chatbot. The chatbot
                    functionality was also only compared to the absence of a chatbot, whereas I think it would be useful
                    to also have a comparison to other functionality such as a search bar. For methodology, I would add
                    clickstream analysis by having a piece of software collect this data, though this would be easier if
                    the evaluation could have been in-person. This evaluation only counted page navigation as a
                    rudimentary metric. </p>
