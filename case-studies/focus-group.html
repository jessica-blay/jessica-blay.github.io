    </div>

    <div class="w3-container" style="width: 70%; margin:auto;">
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            The client was developing a personalized dashboard for university faculty members to show them performance
            in
            their classes along with information about how these statistics could be improved. The data included was
            fake data, not
            personalized for the users of the focus group, but participants were asked to act as if it were. The same
            data was
            used for all participants.<br>
            Key Research Questions:<br>
        <ol>
            <li>What were users' reactions and behavior to the data being provided to them?</li>
            <li>What were users' reactions to seeing negative results from their teaching?</li>
            <li>Can users understand the way the data is presented such that it could be used to improve teaching?</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container" style="width: 70%; margin:auto;">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>This was performed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore there was a requirement for all testing to be
            performed remotely. Due to the busy schedule of participants, sessions could not last longer than
            60 minutes.
            <br>
            In this evaluation we opted for a series of focus groups with a walkthrough analysis of a prototype of the
            website. After the focus group, participants were also emailed a survey for demographic data and to include
            additional information in case they wished not to disagree with others in person.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container" style="width: 70%; margin:auto;">
        <h2>Recruitment</h2>
        <p>
            The personalized dashboard was being designed for a series of universities, and was intended to be viewed by
            professors and department heads to review data. Therefore recruitment was limited to current (or recently
            retired) professors that were (or had been) working within the associated group of universities. As a
            professor himself, our supervisor reached out to colleagues within those universities to gather participants
            for the study. <br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container" style="width: 70%; margin:auto;">
        <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container" style="width: 70%; margin:auto;">
        <h3>Challenge: Schedules</h3>
        <p>Due to professors' busy schedules we were only able to have focus groups lasting 60 minutes. As such we had
            to be very careful with our question selection. Several dry-runs of the questions were performed with
            colleagues to make the questions less vague, prevent straying topic, and questions were combined where
            possible, or ommitted when less relevant. Due to the busy schedules it was also difficult to get a day where
            all participants were available at the same time, therefore we ended up having a series of focus smaller
            focus groups. Smaller focus groups meant that there was more time for answers for each participant.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container" style="width: 70%; margin:auto;">
        <h3>Challenge: Remote Focus Groups</h3>
        <p>We identified several potential problems that may arise from remote focus groups along with solutions. For
            example:

        <table class="w3-table w3-border w3-bordered w3-section">
            <thead>

                <tr class="w3-pale-green">
                    <th>Problem</th>
                    <th>Solution</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Distractions</th>
                <th>Close all other computer applications, and enable "do not disturb" functionality if
                    applicable.<br>Turn
                    off cell phones.</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Mic/Speaker/Camera problems</th>
                <th>Try to get everyone on the call early to confirm no problems. 2 interviewers were available so that
                    1 could take over if technological problems with the other.</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Ease of interruptions</th>
                <th>Remote meetings make it very possible to easily talk over each other. We tried to have each person
                    speak one at a time and use "hand raise" features available.</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Straying answers</th>
                <th>Prompts created to keep participants focused on the question at hand. Where possible, questions were
                    re-worded to prevent straying.</th>
            </tr>
        </table><br>
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="w3-container" style="width: 70%; margin:auto;">
        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Focus groups were transcribed, and then analyzed to determine several dimensions along with the survey
            responses.<br>
            Dimensions such as "Interface" and "Clarity" were identified, and comments were grouped together as either
            positive, negative, or neutral comments within these dimensions.<br>
            Areas of agreements and disagreements between participants within the focus groups were also identified in
            case they affected other results.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container" style="width: 70%; margin:auto;">
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Participants from a more scientific background were confused by the negative results reported, often
                disagreeing with the results, and wanted more of a breakdown as to why the results were negative,
                preferably by having raw data available.</li>
            <li>Participants from a less scientific background seemed more accepting of the results and were focused on
                how to improve their performance.</li>
            <li>All participants felt that the resources provided were insufficient to improve their situation, but with
                varying reasons why.</li>
            <li>There was also a concern that this could be used as an evaluation tool when there may be other
                circumstances not considered in this dataset.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container" style="width: 70%; margin:auto;">
        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Actionable insights were added to pages to make it clearer how this data could be used to improve in the
                future.</li>
            <li>Specific data deficiencies were resolved prior to going live that made those graphs and datasets more
                useful to professors.</li>
            <li>The platform was able to show how raw data could be obtained.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container" style="width: 70%; margin:auto;">
        <h2>What if I had the chance to do it again?</h2>
        <p>If I had the opportunity again, I would have loved to have had much more time to go through the prototype,
            and if it was further in development, be able to perform a usability evaluation where the participants could
            go through it themselves. The participants that wanted to see more data really wanted to be able to dig down
            further to see more information, but those pages were not available, or may have been incomplete. Although
            the focus group helped understand this request for additional data, these participants may have been more
            useful with a more complete prototype.<br>
            I think it is also difficult to accurately act as if negative data is being displayed about your
            performance. Some participants had difficulty relating to the data provided (for example, class sizes were
            too big, or demographic information was very different from their typical classes), which meant their
            reactions to negative data were likely harder to imitate, with the data being so far from their reality. A more
            accurate representation of emotion may be possible if participants were actually looking at their
            personalized data, but it had been modified to show more negative results than reality.<br>
